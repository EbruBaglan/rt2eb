    <title>Research Track 2 - Assignment 1 - Solution</title>

    <detaileddescription>
<para>In this assignment of the Research Track 2, previously implemented solution for Assignment 3 of Research Trach 1 is reimplemented to give user a Jupyter Notebook interface. Interactive elements like buttons, boxes are presented for the user to choose among 3 different modalities of the robot&apos;s movement. The interface should be able to get the user request for modality, get additional input from user depending on the modality of choice and let the robot execute one of the following behaviors: 1) autonomously reach a x,y coordinate inserted by the user 2) let the user drive the robot with the keyboard 3) let the user drive the robot assisting them to avoid collisions.</para>
<para>After the initialization of the robot, the output of the laser readings are shown to user through Jupyter Notebook.</para>

<title>Structure and How it works</title>
<para>Roslaunch file gets user input mod and starts the needed nodes for the desired mod.</para>
<para>Mod1 starts an initializer node, which then calls for another node through roslaunch to send user input goals to move_base/goal topic.</para>
<para>Mod2 calls for teleopt_twist_keyboard to take user direction inputs.</para>
<para>Mod3 calls for a modified version teleopt_twist_keyboard(to publish on /cmd_vel_**raw**) to take user direction inputs, and calls another node to manipulate user inputs when user feels like crashing into a wall.</para>

<title>Improvements</title>
<para>1) Cancelling a goal mid-time can be added. 3) An option to exit a node anytime can be added. 4) rosclean command can be added if user has a huge size of .ros/log initially.</para>
<para>Interesting things to note: if -.py files include rosparameter setting/getting, and if the roscore is not called, it raises an error of OSError: [Errno 99] Cannot assign requested address. Even after if the mentioned parameter is not set yet, it raises another error during make html command.</para>

<title>Problems Faced and Solved</title>
<para>1) <bold>Rviz not showing laser-scan outputs (red-lines):</bold> It turns out Ubuntu may have some problems with GPU, and if the package has a GPU laser sensor, the output is not read. Some hero on the Internet commented this beautiful words: &quot;You&apos;re getting messages, so it&apos;s definitely on. Please, try the non-GPU plugin (remove gpu_ everywhere in the sensor definition).&quot; and &quot;the root cause is an incompatibility with the graphics card/driver; what do you have? I also seem to remember having to upgrade to a newer version of Gazebo to get a GPU plugin working correctly, but that may have been specific to a different lidar model. In any case, the choice is yours whether to further pursue the GPU version of this plugin or settle for the CPU version.&quot; Full post is here: <ulink url="https://answers.ros.org/question/370627/cant-see-scan-in-rviz/">https://answers.ros.org/question/370627/cant-see-scan-in-rviz/</ulink></para>
<para>2) <bold>Rviz not showing map (no map received error):</bold> This answer directed me towards the idea that &quot;I should run map_server&quot;: <ulink url="https://get-help.robotigniteacademy.com/t/rviz-no-map-received/4721">https://get-help.robotigniteacademy.com/t/rviz-no-map-received/4721</ulink>. Then, I went here: <ulink url="http://wiki.ros.org/map_server,">http://wiki.ros.org/map_server,</ulink> which directed me downloading the &apos;navigation.git&apos; in here: <ulink url="https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation">https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation</ulink> . After catkin_make, I received the following error</para>
